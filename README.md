[Neural Network Classifier](https://github.com/lonesome-data/Colab_ANN_Classifier)<br/>
Description: Artificial neural network on Google CoLab's VM with TensorFlow backend. Binomial classifier predicts which of two consulting agencies conducted analysis. Analogous to predicting which of two professors graded a student's exam given only questions and answers.

[K-Means](https://github.com/lonesome-data/OS4601_Advanced_Data_Analysis)<br/>
Decription: The research objective of this project was to demonstrate the possibility of quantitatively estimating spatio-temporal distribution and movement of individual mobile phone users by partitioning mobile phone metadata.   

[XGBoost](https://github.com/lonesome-data/XGBoost) <br/>
Description: Regularly winning many online data science competitions and used at scale across different industries, link leads to classification and regression mastery projects completed through DataCamp. 

[NLP](https://github.com/lonesome-data/CY3650-Project)<br/>
Description: Natural Language Processing (NLP) skills are applicable to digital resarch as the vast proportion of the world's data is unstructured and includes a great deal of text.  This project analyzes Rudyard Kipling's novel *Indian Tales* using the Natural Language ToolKit (`nltk`). The novel is scraped from the website [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) using the Python package `requests` and extracted using `BeautifulSoup`. The process captures critical aspects of tokenization and stopwords.

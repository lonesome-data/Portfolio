[OS4601_Advanced_Data_Analysis](https://github.com/lonesome-data/OS4601_Advanced_Data_Analysis)
Decription: The research objective of this project was to demonstrate the possibility of quantitatively estimating spatio-temporal distribution and movement of individual mobile phone users by partitioning mobile phone metadata.  

[XGBoost](https://github.com/lonesome-data/XGBoost) 
Description: vet projects and post

[NLP in Python](https://github.com/lonesome-data/CY3650-Project)
Natural Language Processing (NLP) skills are applicable to digital resarch as the vast proportion of the world's data is unstructured and includes a great deal of text.  This project analyzes Rudyard Kipling's novel *Indian Tales* using the Natural Language ToolKit (`nltk`). The novel is scraped from the website [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) using the Python package `requests` and extracted using `BeautifulSoup`. The process captures critical aspects of tokenization and stopwords.
